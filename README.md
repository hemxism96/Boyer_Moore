# Boyer_Moore

It's Boyer Moore Algorithm implemented in Scala

## Project Objective

- Understand the concept of functional programming
- Understand scala features by using this programing langauge

## Considerations

- No Side-Effects: functions only depend on the input
- Avoid while/for and try/catch/finally when writing functional code
- Make the best use of tail reculsive

## What is Boyer Moore Algorithm

It's one type of String searching algorithms and starts matching from the last character of the pattern following the text from left to right.
It combines two approaches (Bad Character and Good Suffix Heuristic) and uses greatest offset suggested by the two heuristics at every step.
